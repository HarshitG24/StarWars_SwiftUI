 Planet(name: "Tatooine", description: "Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history. Part of a binary star system, the planet was oppressed by scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had no natural surface vegetation.", suns: 2, Moons: 3, rotation_period: 34, orbital_period: 304, climate: "Hot and Arid", atmosphere: "Breathable"),
 
 Planet(name: "Coruscant", description: "Coruscant, also known as Imperial Center during the rule of the Galactic Empire, was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet, collectively known as Galactic City— in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of approximately one trillion citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza and the Senate Building.", suns: 1, Moons: 4, rotation_period: 24, orbital_period: 365, climate: "Temperature", atmosphere: "Breathable"),
 
 Planet(name: "Hoth", description: "Hoth was a remote, icy planet that was the sixth planet in the star system of the same name. It notably hosted Echo Base, the temporary headquarters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, until the Galactic Empire located the Rebels, initiating a major confrontation known as the Battle of Hoth.", suns: 1, Moons: 3, rotation_period: 0, orbital_period: 549, climate: "Frigid", atmosphere: "Breathable, Clean")
